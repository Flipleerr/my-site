# my-site
a repo storing my website, hosted here. also, cool shit i wanted to save.

# introduction
*this* is an attempt at making a semi-functional website for myself, hoping it won't turn out as a glorified biography of myself (or at least the 10 years of it that i remember)

this is also a test of my **EPIC HTMLJSCSS GAMER SKILLZ** so i wanna see how insane i make this website look after like 2 years of working on it from now

# storage
i mentioned storage in the about section, so here's the kicker immediatly

it's just a way of storing cool shit i found on the internet and keeping it on here, accesible for everyone. download what you want, download what you can. it's the wild west ALL OVER AGAIN--
